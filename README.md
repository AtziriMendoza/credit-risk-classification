# credit-risk-classification

The purpose of this project was to create a supervised learning model that would let us know whether a loan is high-risk or healthy. It will let us know this based on the features 'loan_size', 'interest_rate', 'borrower_income', 'debt_to_income', 'num_of_accounts', 'derrogatory_marks', 'total_debt', and 'loan_status'. We fed it data to train the model to allow us to make predictions with the testing data. 

I generated a model that accurately predicted a healthy loan 100% of the time and a risky loan 89% of the time. It seems that there was not enough data on loans that are high risk for the model to accurately predict them. To improve this model I would like to include data with with more high-risk loans so that I am better able to train the model to predict when a loan would be high-risk which would be more beneficial to minimize losses to the bank.
